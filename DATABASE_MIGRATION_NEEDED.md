## Migration: Filter Completed Properties from Inspector View

### **Issue Fixed:**
- Inspector app was showing multiple inspections per property
- Properties with completed inspections should only appear in audit center
- Inspectors should only see properties available for new inspections

### **Database Changes Required:**

Run this SQL in your Supabase SQL editor to update the `get_properties_with_inspections` function:

```sql
-- Filter completed properties from inspector view
-- This ensures only properties without completed inspections show in the inspector app
-- Properties with completed inspections should go to the audit center instead

CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION public.get_properties_with_inspections(_user_id uuid DEFAULT NULL::uuid)
 RETURNS TABLE(
   property_id uuid, 
   name text, 
   property_address text, 
   property_vrbo_url text, 
   property_airbnb_url text, 
   property_status text, 
   property_created_at timestamp without time zone, 
   inspection_count bigint, 
   completed_inspection_count bigint, 
   active_inspection_count bigint,
   draft_inspection_count bigint,
   latest_inspection_id uuid, 
   latest_inspection_completed boolean

-- Add a comment explaining the business logic
COMMENT ON FUNCTION public.get_properties_with_inspections IS 
'Returns properties available for inspection. Excludes properties with completed inspections unless they have been rejected and need re-inspection. Completed inspections should be processed through the audit center instead of appearing in the inspector interface.';
```

### **Business Logic:**
1. **Inspector App** shows only:
   - Properties with no completed inspections
   - Properties with rejected inspections (allowing re-inspection)

2. **Completed inspections** should:
   - Disappear from inspector app
   - Appear in audit center for AI processing and review
   - Only reappear in inspector app if rejected by auditor

3. **Prevents multiple concurrent inspections per property**

### **After Migration:**
- Properties with completed inspections will no longer show in inspector app
- Inspectors will only see properties available for new inspections
- Completed inspections will be routed to audit center properly

**Run this migration in Supabase SQL editor to fix the multiple inspections issue.**
