## **üéØ REVIEW FEEDBACK GUIDELINES**

### **Providing Feedback**

#### **Constructive Comments**
```markdown
// ‚úÖ GOOD: Specific, actionable feedback
**Performance Issue**: This component re-renders on every keystroke. Consider 
debouncing the search input to improve performance.

**Suggestion**: 
```typescript
const debouncedSearch = useMemo(
  () => debounce(handleSearch, 300),
  [handleSearch]
);
```

**Security Concern**: User input is not validated. This could lead to injection 
attacks. Please add input validation using our Zod schema.

**Code Quality**: Consider extracting this 50-line function into smaller, 
single-purpose functions for better readability and testability.
```

#### **Comment Types**
- **üî¥ Must Fix**: Critical issues that block merge
- **üü° Should Fix**: Important improvements that should be addressed

- **Address all feedback** - Don't ignore comments
- **Ask for clarification** - If feedback is unclear
- **Explain decisions** - When you disagree with suggestions
- **Update the code** - Make requested changes
- **Thank reviewers** - Acknowledge their time and effort
