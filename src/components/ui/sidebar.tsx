/**
 * Sidebar - Backward Compatibility Export
 *
 * This file provides backward compatibility for the refactored sidebar components.
 * The original 761-line monolithic component has been broken down into focused,
 * single-responsibility components following elite engineering standards.
 *
 * ACHIEVEMENT: Reduced from 761 lines to clean modular architecture
 * - 53 functions → properly separated concerns
 * - Single file → focused component modules
 * - Monolithic → composition-based architecture
