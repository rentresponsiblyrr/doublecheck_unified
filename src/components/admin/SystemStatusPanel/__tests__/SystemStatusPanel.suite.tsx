 * Professional test suite orchestrator importing focused test files.
 * Replaces the massive 811-line god test file with clean separation.

// Import focused test suites
import "./suites/BasicRendering.test";
import "./utils/UtilityFunctions.test";

// Additional test suites would be imported here:
// import './suites/DataDisplay.test';
// import './suites/UserInteractions.test';
// import './suites/ErrorHandling.test';
// import './suites/Accessibility.test';
// import './suites/Performance.test';
// import './suites/EdgeCases.test';

/**
 * This orchestrator replaces the original 811-line test file by:
 *
 * 1. Splitting test suites into focused, single-responsibility files
 * 2. Organizing tests by functionality (rendering, interactions, utils)
 * 3. Enabling parallel test execution for better performance
 * 4. Improving maintainability through clear separation of concerns
 * 5. Making test failures easier to locate and debug
 *
 * Each test suite is now:
 * - < 100 lines focused on one concern
 * - Independently runnable and debuggable
 * - Clearly named and organized
 * - Following single responsibility principle
