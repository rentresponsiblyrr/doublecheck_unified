## **üö´ BANNED PATTERNS - IMMEDIATE TERMINATION**

These patterns will result in **immediate termination**:

### **1. NUCLEAR ERROR HANDLING**
- `window.location.reload()`
- `window.location.assign()`
- `location.href = '/error'`

### **2. REACT DEPENDENCY LIES**
- Removing useEffect dependencies to "fix" loops
- Empty dependency arrays when dependencies exist

### **3. GOD COMPONENTS**
- Components >300 lines
- Components handling multiple responsibilities
- Monolithic architecture

### **4. TYPE ESCAPE HATCHES**
- Using `any` in business logic
- Using `@ts-ignore` to bypass errors
- Giving up on type safety

### **5. SERVICE LAYER PYRAMIDS**
- 5+ abstraction layers for simple operations
- Unnecessary enterprise patterns
- Over-engineering simple problems
