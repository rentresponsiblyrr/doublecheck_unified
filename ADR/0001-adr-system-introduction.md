# ADR-0001: Architecture Decision Records System Introduction

## Status
Accepted

## Context
As STR Certified grows and multiple AI coding agents collaborate on the codebase, we need a structured way to document architectural decisions. This ensures continuity between AI sessions and provides a historical record of why certain technical choices were made.

## Decision
We will implement an Architecture Decision Records (ADR) system that:
1. Documents significant architectural decisions made by AI agents
2. Provides a standardized template for recording decisions
3. Integrates with our AI decision logging system
4. Maintains a chronological record of architectural evolution

## Rationale
- **Continuity**: Future AI agents can understand past architectural decisions
- **Transparency**: Clear reasoning behind technical choices
- **Consistency**: Standardized format for all architectural decisions
- **Traceability**: Link decisions to implementation changes
- **Learning**: Build institutional knowledge across AI sessions

## Consequences
### Positive
- Better architectural consistency across AI coding sessions
- Reduced time spent re-analyzing already-decided architectural questions
- Clear audit trail of architectural evolution
- Improved onboarding for new AI agents working on the codebase

### Negative
- Additional overhead for documenting decisions
- Potential for ADRs to become stale if not maintained
- Need for discipline in keeping ADRs up to date

## Implementation
1. Create ADR directory structure
2. Develop ADR template system
3. Integrate with AI decision logging
4. Establish ADR review process
5. Create tooling for ADR management

## Related Decisions
- This is the foundational decision for the ADR system
- Future architectural decisions will reference this ADR

## Notes
- ADRs should be written in Markdown for easy version control
- Each ADR should have a unique number and descriptive title
- ADRs are immutable once accepted - superseding decisions should reference the original
- AI agents should create ADRs for any decision that affects system architecture, technology choices, or significant design patterns
