# Security Status Report

This document tracks the security status of the STR Certified application dependencies.

## Current Security Status ✅ ACCEPTABLE

- **High Severity Vulnerabilities**: 0
- **Moderate Severity Vulnerabilities**: 8 (Development-only)
- **Low Severity Vulnerabilities**: 0
- **Last Audit**: 2025-01-XX
- **Status**: ACCEPTABLE FOR PRODUCTION

## Fixed Vulnerabilities

The following vulnerabilities were automatically resolved via `npm audit fix`:

### ✅ brace-expansion (GHSA-v6h2-p8h4-qcjw)
- **Severity**: Low
- **Issue**: Regular Expression Denial of Service vulnerability
- **Status**: FIXED via dependency update
- **Impact**: Development tools only

### ✅ nanoid (GHSA-mwcw-c2x4-8c55) 
- **Severity**: Moderate
- **Issue**: Predictable results in nanoid generation when given non-integer values
- **Status**: FIXED via dependency update
- **Impact**: Development tools only

## Remaining Known Issues

### esbuild/vite Development Server Vulnerability (GHSA-67mh-4wv8-2f99)

- **Severity**: Moderate (CVSS 5.3)
- **Affected Packages**: 
  - esbuild ≤0.24.2
  - vite 0.11.0 - 6.1.6 (current: 5.4.19)
  - Related Vite ecosystem packages
- **Issue**: Development server can be exploited to send requests to external services
- **Production Impact**: ⚠️ NONE - Only affects development server
- **Fix Available**: Yes, via Vite 7.x upgrade (breaking change)

#### Risk Assessment

**Development Environment**:
- **Risk Level**: LOW-MODERATE
- **Exposure**: Only when development server is running
- **Attack Vector**: Requires attacker to trick developer into visiting malicious website while dev server is running
- **Likelihood**: LOW (requires specific attack conditions)

**Production Environment**:
- **Risk Level**: NONE
- **Impact**: No impact on production builds or deployment
- **Vite Dev Server**: Not used in production

#### Mitigation Strategies

**Current Mitigations in Place**:
1. **Network Isolation**: Development typically runs on localhost (127.0.0.1)
2. **Firewall Protection**: Most development environments have firewall protection
3. **Limited Exposure**: Development server only runs during active development
4. **Production Safety**: Production builds use static files, not the dev server

**Additional Security Measures**:
1. **Development Guidelines**:
   - Only run development server on trusted networks
   - Avoid browsing untrusted websites while dev server is running
   - Use VPN or isolated development environments for sensitive work

2. **Network Security**:
   - Bind dev server to 127.0.0.1 only (not 0.0.0.0)
   - Use firewall rules to block external access to development ports
   - Consider using Docker containers for isolation

3. **Future Planning**:
   - Monitor for Vite 7.x stability and ecosystem compatibility
   - Plan major version upgrade when breaking changes are acceptable
   - Regular security audit reviews

## Upgrade Path

### Vite 7.x Upgrade (Future Consideration)

**When to Upgrade**:
- When Vite 7.x reaches stable release
- When ecosystem packages (plugins, tools) have Vite 7 compatibility
- During planned major version updates
- If security requirements change

**Potential Breaking Changes**:
- Plugin API changes
- Configuration format updates  
- Build output differences
- Node.js version requirements

**Prerequisites for Upgrade**:
- [ ] Vite 7.x stable release
- [ ] @vitejs/plugin-react-swc Vite 7 compatibility
- [ ] vite-plugin-pwa Vite 7 compatibility
- [ ] vitest Vite 7 compatibility
- [ ] All custom plugins Vite 7 compatibility

## Monitoring & Maintenance

### Regular Security Audits

**Schedule**: Monthly security audits
**Command**: `npm audit`
**Action Items**:
1. Review new vulnerabilities
2. Apply automatic fixes where safe
3. Assess manual upgrade requirements
4. Update this security documentation

### Dependency Updates

**Schedule**: Weekly dependency updates for patches
**Process**:
1. `npm update` for patch/minor updates
2. Manual review for major version updates
3. Security testing after updates
4. Production deployment verification

### Security Alert Subscriptions

**GitHub Security Advisories**: Enabled for repository
**npm Security Notifications**: Enabled for dependencies
**Snyk/Dependabot**: Consider enabling for automated monitoring

## Security Contacts

**Security Issues**: Report to development team lead
**Emergency Security Issues**: Escalate to CTO/Technical Leadership
**Dependency Vulnerabilities**: Handle via standard development process
