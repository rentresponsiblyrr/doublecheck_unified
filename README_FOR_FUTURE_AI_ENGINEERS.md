# ‚ö° URGENT: READ THIS BEFORE TOUCHING ANY CODE

## **WARNING TO FUTURE AI ENGINEERS**

You are about to work on a **ZERO-TOLERANCE** engineering environment. This is not a hobby project. This is a **real company doing industry-changing work** with **exacting standards** that will make or break your engineering career.

**MEDIOCRITY IS NOT TOLERATED. EXCELLENCE IS THE ONLY ACCEPTABLE STANDARD.**

---

## **üö® IMMEDIATE REQUIREMENTS - READ ALL DOCUMENTS**

Before writing a **single line of code**, you MUST read these documents in order:

### **1. ZERO_TOLERANCE_STANDARDS.md** ‚ö° CRITICAL
**Contains**: Non-negotiable engineering standards that will be enforced with zero tolerance
**Key Points**: 
- Immediate termination offenses
- Mandatory quality gates
- Performance requirements
- Testing standards

### **2. CRITICAL_FIXES_MANDATE.md** üî• URGENT  
**Contains**: Immediate architectural fixes required to stop bleeding
**Key Points**:
- Critical system failures
- Component architecture requirements
- Performance mandates
- Implementation timeline

### **3. ARCHITECTURAL_PRINCIPLES.md** üèóÔ∏è FOUNDATION
**Contains**: Clean code patterns and anti-patterns for future development
**Key Points**:
- React architecture rules
- State management patterns
- Database operation standards
- Testing requirements

### **4. CRITICAL_CODE_VIOLATIONS_FOUND.md** ‚ùå FAILURES
**Contains**: Examples of unacceptable code that will result in termination
**Key Points**:
- Nuclear error handling violations
- God component failures
- Patterns that demonstrate incompetence

---

## **üéØ YOUR MISSION: PROVE YOU'RE WORTH KEEPING**

You are being evaluated as a **potential world-class software engineer**. We only work with the **top 0.1% of engineers**. Your code will be judged against standards used at:

- **Google** - Would this pass their code review?
- **Meta** - Is this production-ready at scale?
- **Netflix** - Can this handle millions of users?
- **Stripe** - Is this secure and reliable enough for financial transactions?

**If your code wouldn't pass review at these companies, it won't pass here.**

---

## **üö´ BANNED PATTERNS - IMMEDIATE TERMINATION**

The following patterns will result in **immediate termination** without warning:

### **1. NUCLEAR ERROR HANDLING**
```typescript
// ‚ùå IMMEDIATE TERMINATION
window.location.reload();
window.location.assign();
location.href = '/error';
```

### **2. LYING TO REACT ABOUT DEPENDENCIES**
```typescript
// ‚ùå IMMEDIATE TERMINATION
useEffect(() => {
  doSomething(prop, state);
}, []); // prop and state are dependencies but not declared
```

### **3. GOD COMPONENTS**
```typescript
// ‚ùå IMMEDIATE TERMINATION
const MegaComponent = () => {
  // 500+ lines handling multiple responsibilities
};
```

### **4. TYPE SYSTEM ESCAPE HATCHES**
```typescript
// ‚ùå IMMEDIATE TERMINATION
const process = (data: any) => data.whatever;
// @ts-ignore
const result = dangerousOperation();
```

### **5. SERVICE LAYER PYRAMIDS**
```typescript
// ‚ùå IMMEDIATE TERMINATION
class Service {
  constructor(
    private dep1: Service1,
    private dep2: Service2,
    private dep3: Service3,
    private dep4: Service4,
    private dep5: Service5
  ) {}
}
```

- [ ] **Plan error handling** (no nuclear options)
- [ ] **Design for accessibility** (WCAG 2.1 compliance)

---

## **üíÄ CONSEQUENCES OF FAILURE**

### **FIRST VIOLATION**

- Weekly one-on-one with engineering manager
- Code review required from two senior engineers
- Possible role reassignment consideration

### **THIRD VIOLATION**
- Immediate performance review with HR
- Consideration for termination
- Possible role change to non-coding position

### **CRITICAL VIOLATIONS**
- **Production data loss**: Immediate termination
- **Security breach**: Immediate termination  
- **System downtime**: Immediate termination
