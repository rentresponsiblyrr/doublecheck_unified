To push the code to GitHub, run this command in your terminal:

cd /Users/ryanrabideau/doublecheck-field-view/lovable-extraction/str-certified-migration/str-certified

git push -u origin main

If you get an authentication error, you may need to:

1. Use GitHub personal access token:
   - Go to GitHub Settings > Developer settings > Personal access tokens
   - Generate a new token with 'repo' permissions
   - Use the token as your password when prompted

2. Or use SSH:
   git remote set-url origin git@github.com:rentresponsiblyrr/doublecheck_unified.git
   git push -u origin main

3. Or use GitHub CLI:
   gh auth login
   git push -u origin main

The repository is ready and committed locally. Just needs your authentication to push!
